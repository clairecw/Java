INSTRUCTIONS
=========================
GAME CREATION MODE
-------------------
NEW GAME is the first game mode where you can create your own simple Java
game. Your game will let the user press keyboard keys to move. The
objective of your game is for the user to A. collect all collectible items
in the game, or B. get to the door, while avoiding monsters. You can
customize your game by:

changing the number of monsters and items,

changing what keys make the user move in which direction,

changing the messages displayed when the user wins and loses,

toggling between objectives A or B as listed above, and

changing the image sprites of the user, monsters, and items.

Your game can be tested out and played in a popout window after pressing 
"Play". The game can be paused and played with the spacebar.

To the right of the game and options screen, a code fragment of how your
game would look in Java code will be displayed. As you make adjustments to 
your customized game, the sample code on the right will be adjusted 
accordingly. Hover over lines of the code to see what they do or how
they work.
Please note: this is only a portion of a Java program and
will not run on its own, it only shows the most important parts
implementing KeyListeners and Timers.

When you are satisfied with the game you have created, you can save the
game to be loaded and played again at a later time.

In the second mode of the game, LOAD GAME, you can, evidently, load any
games you have previously saved. Simply select the name of the game and
press "load".
