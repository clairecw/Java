INSTRUCTIONS
=========================
GAME CREATION MODE
-------------------
NEW GAME is the first game mode where 
you can create your own simple Java
game. Your game will let the user press 
keyboard keys to move. The objective of your 
game is for the user to A. collect all 
collectible items in the game, or B. get 
to the door, while avoiding monsters. You 
can customize your game by:

changing the number of monsters and items,



changing what keys make the user move in 
which direction, changing the messages 
displayed when the user wins and loses,
toggling between objectives A or B as 
listed above, and changing the image 
sprites of the user, monsters, and items.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Your game can be tested out and played in
a popout window after pressing "Play". The game 
can be paused and played with the spacebar.










To the right of the game and options screen,
a code fragment of how your game would look 
in Java code will be displayed. As you make 
adjustments to your customized game, the sample 
code on the right will be adjusted accordingly. 
Hover over lines of the code to see what they 
do or how they work.
Please note: this is only a portion of 
a Java program and will not run on its own; 
it only shows the most important parts
implementing KeyListeners and Timers.




When you are satisfied with the game you 
have created, you can save the game to be 
loaded and played again at a later time.


LOAD GAME MODE
-------------------
In the second mode of the game, LOAD GAME, 
you can, evidently, load any games you 
have previously saved. Simply select the 
name of the game and press "load".






CHALLENGE MODE
-------------------
In the third mode, Challenge, you can test 
your Timer and KeyListener capabilities by 
completing snippets of code according to what 
each question prompts.
Type in your answer in the blank and press 
enter to submit it. A correct answer will add 
one to three points to your score, while an 
incorrect one will subtract five seconds from 
your time left.
